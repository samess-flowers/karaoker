A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is, also known as a buster
Always talking about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time
And no, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
But a scrub is checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like glass and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a deadbeat ass, so
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time
And no, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yeah son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
