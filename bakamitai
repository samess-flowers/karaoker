I've been a fool, and you've been childish
You fell down, you got hurt chasing sweeter dreams
Never could hide the truth in your eyes
That's how I knew that smile was a lie

I love you is something you never say
Couldn't get it out, always just pulled away
So then why, please won't you tell me why
You could find the words to say goodbye

I'm such a mess, I'm lost, I'm no good at this
I'm in love, still in love, still in love with you
Hard as I try, I can't even drink this pain away
Memories of you, twisting my view, I've been a fool
